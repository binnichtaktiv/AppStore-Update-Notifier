## **Prerequisites:**
1. **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is properly installed.
2. **Telegram bot token**: Required for sending Telegram notifications.
3. **Telegram chat ID**: So the script knows where to send the notifications.

## **Installation:**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```git clone https://github.com/binnichtaktiv/AppStore-Update-Notifier```


```cd AppStoreUpdateNotifier```

### 2. Install the requirements
```pip3 install requests bs4 pyTelegramBotAPI```

### 3. Telegram Bot Setup
- Set up a new Telegram bot by speaking to the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). After creating the bot, you'll receive a token.
- To get your chat ID, send `/id` to [Rose](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) on Telegram.

  Enter the bot token and chat ID the first time you run the program

## **Usage:**

### 1. To Add an App for Tracking
```python3 updateNotifier.py add [App-Link]```


Replace `[App-Link]` with the link to the iOS app on the App Store.

### 2. To Check for Updates
```python3 updateNotifier.py check```


This command will initiate the checking process. You'll be notified on Telegram if any tracked app has a new version available. The script checks every 20 minutes.

## **Why Scrape Instead of Using API?**:
You might be wondering why the script scrapes the App Store instead of just using Apple's official API. The answer is quite simple:
1. **Speed**: Scraping proves to be several hours faster than fetching data through the API. This ensures that you get the notifications in almost real-time.
2. **Timely Updates**: For reasons best known to Apple, updates reflected via their API often lag behind. Scraping ensures that you get notified of updates the moment they hit the App Store.

With the way this script works, you can get results a few hours earlier than with Apples API
